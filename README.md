# distributed systems notes

I'm auditing a class on distributed systems, taught by Paul Krzyzanowski a professor at Rutgers university and writing notes on them.
Most of the material can be found on the (course website) [https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/], but I'm also incorporating some topics not covered. For example, using apache thrift for RPC.
